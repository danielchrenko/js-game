notes: using vim

sprite is a constructor function
in sprite we establish functions:
update
newPos

update is used to update the canvas, on each frame everything gets deleted
so we call update to redraw all the sprites on each frame in order
to simulate movement

in this case for sprite, an image is used instead of the params to draw a rect

speed work same way as comp speed did

next add animations
